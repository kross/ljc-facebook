This code was created for a lightning presentation entitled "Being Social: a quick introduction to integrating with Facebook" at a London Java Community event. It is an example of the server side authorisation flow for a Facebook app written in Java.

To try it for yourself:
1. Clone repo
2. Build with maven
3. Throw war on app server (eg. tomcat)
4. Goto http://apps.facebook.com/ljc-integration [points to localhost]  OR  create an app yourself
